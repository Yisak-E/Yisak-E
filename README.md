Hi there, I'm Yisak Metaferiya 👋
I'm a passionate software engineering student dedicated to building practical and user-friendly applications. I enjoy solving real-world problems through code and am always eager to learn new technologies.

Below are a couple of projects I've been working on.

Featured Projects
1. General Purpose Application Suite
A web-based application designed to be an all-in-one productivity and lifestyle tool. The goal is to provide users with a single platform to manage various aspects of their daily lives.

Key Features:

🗓️ Schedule Management: A weekly timetable to organize events and appointments.

📚 Study Planner: Tools to create and manage study plans effectively.

💼 Job Search: An optimized search engine to help users find job opportunities.

☀️ Real-time Weather: Instant weather updates for the user's current location.

🧠 Memory Game: A fun and engaging game to boost cognitive skills.

🍎 Nutrition Tracker: A module to help users track their daily food intake.

✅ To-Do List: A feature to manage tasks and track their completion status.

Technologies: (You can update this section with the specific technologies you used)

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Potentially a framework like React or Vue.js)

Backend: Node.js, Express.js (or any other backend technology)

APIs: Used for weather data and job listings.

2. NutriTrack © - Personal Nutrition Tracker
A robust, console-based application written in Java that allows users to monitor their diet with precision. This project demonstrates strong object-oriented programming principles and file-based data persistence.

Key Features:

Detailed Meal Logging: Log breakfast, lunch, dinner, and snacks with specific food items and quantities.

Persistent Storage: All meal history is saved to a user_consumption.csv file and loaded at startup, ensuring no data is lost.

Dynamic Meal Updates: Users can easily update any past meal by adding or removing food items. The meal selection interface is paginated to handle long lists of entries gracefully.

Custom Goal Setting: Set and modify daily goals for calories, protein, carbs, fats, cholesterol, and sodium.

Real-Time Progress View: A dedicated screen shows how much of each nutrient has been consumed versus the daily goal, displaying the remaining amount.

Comprehensive Reporting: Generate daily, weekly, and monthly reports to analyze nutritional intake trends over time.

Extensible Food Database: The application uses a food_data.csv file, making it easy to expand the list of available foods.

Technologies & Concepts:

Language: Java

Core Concepts: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), Data Structures (ArrayList), File I/O (Reading/Writing CSV), Console-based UI.
